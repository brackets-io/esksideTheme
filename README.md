# esksideTheme for Brackets

A Brackets theme developed by [Eskside Design](https://esksidedesign.co.uk).

This theme is free to use and edit as you see fit.

The theme is dark with mainly green hues. It also edits some of the UI too but you will need to install another package to see those changes take effect. The package required is [brackets-uitheming by Ryan McKay](https://github.com/notasz/brackets-uitheming). That package allows editing of the project file tree, toolbars etc. It's not essential for the general theme to work, it just adds a little more sugar.
